        !!! Info
            The default behaviour is to just return the same state that was passed.

            In some models, multiple representations of the same information are kept,
            but only one is initialized by the task. A typical example is a task that
            initializes a model's effector state, e.g. the location of the endpoint of
            the arm at the start of a reach. In the case of a two-link arm, the location
            of the arm's endpoint directly constrains the joint angles. For the state to
            be consistent, the values for the joint angles should match the values for
            effector position. Importantly, the joint angles are the representation that
            is used by the ODE describing the arm. Therefore we call
            `state_consistency_update` after initializing the state and before the first
            forward pass the model, to make sure the joint angles are consistent with
            the effector position.

            In this way we avoid having to specify redundant information in
            `AbstractTask`, and each model can handle the logic of what makes
            a state consistent, with respect to its own operations.

    !!! Info
        `AbstractStagedModel` defines its operations as transformations to parts of
        a state PyTree. Each stage of a model consists of passing a particular substate
        of the model to a callable that operates on it, returning an updated substate.
        However, in some cases the new substate does not depend on the previous
        substate, but is generated entirely from some other inputs.

        For example, a linear neural network layer outputs an array of a certain shape,
        but only requires some input array—and not its prior output (state) array—to
        do so. We can use a module like `eqx.nn.Linear` to update a part of a model's
        state, as the callable of one of its model stages; however, the signature of
        `Linear` only accepts `input`, and not `state`. By wrapping in this function, we
        can make it accept `state` as well, though it is simply discarded.

    Arguments:
        callable: The callable to wrap.
        pass_key: If `True`, the keyword argument `key` will be forwarded to the wrapped
            callable. If `False`, it will be discarded. Discarding is useful if the
            wrapped callable does not accept a `key` argument.
