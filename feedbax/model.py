        The default behaviour is to just return the same state. However, in
        models where it is customary to initialize (say) the effector state 
        but not the plant configuration state, this method should be used 
        to ensure that the configuration state is initialized properly. 
        
        This avoids having to define how both states should be initialized
        in `AbstractTask`, which would require knowledge not only of the 
        structure of the state, but also of the model interface that 
        provides particular operations for modifying the state. Though, I'm not 
        sure that would be a bad thing, as the model state objects tend to 
        mirror the operations done on them anyway.
        
        However, this approach also has the advantage that these consistency
        checks can be arbitrarily complex and important to the model 
        functioning properly; it is useful for the model to be able to 
        render a state consistent, with respect to its other normal operations.

    a state PyTree. In each case, the substate that is operated on is passed
    to the module that returns the updated substate. However, in some cases
    the new substate does not depend on the previous substate. For example,
    a linear network layer takes some inputs and returns some outputs, and
    on the next iteration, the linear layer's outputs do not conventionally 
    depend on its previous outputs, like an RNN cell's would.
